**QUICK REFERENCE**
- **Note** Heating and Cooling cycles have to be done differently.
- The top part of the display is called `PV` and the bottom part is `SV`.
- Press the `SET` button, the `PV` indicates `STG` (segment). eg. Choose `0001`
- Press `SET` again for `dly` (delay) and set the delay time in *minutes*. `0000` to start immediately.
- Press `SET` again for `set 1` (First temperature setting). Each segment can have 10 settings. Use the `up` and `down` keys to set the Temperature Set Point 1.
- Press `SET` again for `rtme` (Ramp time) in *minutes*
- Press `SET` again for Hold time in *minutes*
- Repeat this process for the next 9 set points, if you need them or you can just press enter to end the settings.
- And now you to press **RESET** to start the new settings else it will still be executing the old settings. And depending on the settings, the internal micro-controller may take a long time to calculate the control routine before starting. So have patience!
