# CAD 
This wiki contains all the details (except the private and propreitary info) for the CAD tools used at Advanced VLSI Lab at SIT, BBSR.

## OPEN-SOURCE CUSTOM DESIGN FLOW 
This section contains the instruction to setup open-source CAD tools (ngspice, Sue2, xschem, magic & netgen) in a Virtual Machine (Virtual Box) running a Ubuntu-based Linux distribution LXLE. Although the binaries of the CAD tools are compiled and tested on a 64-bit LXLE Linux distribution, it should run on other 64-bit Ubuntu or Debian based distribution like Xubuntu.
