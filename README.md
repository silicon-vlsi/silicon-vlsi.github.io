# Advanced VLSI Laboratory, Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar 

The Advanced VLSI Laboratory is a Center of Excellence for training and research in the area of CMOS integrated circuits (IC) and electronic system design & manufacturing (ESDM). Our primary goal is to provide an ecosystem for fostering real-life, project-based learning for the next generation engineering students and fresh graduates aspiring to join the VLSI industry. This will allow our students to be industry ready, bridging a critical gap between the academia and industry.

## Capabilities

- Execute turnkey projects using industry-standard integrated circuit technologies. This includes system design, circuit design, simulation and layout of mixed-signal IP blocks. Assembly of chip-level layout and full industrial-grade temperature (-40C to 125C) characterization.
- Capable of design, layout and characterize industry-grade analog and digital IP blocks including but not limited to bandgap reference, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, Serial Protocol Interface (SPI), I2C, oscillators, Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs), SRAM, Linear regulators and switch-capacitor power management ICs.
- NDA with leading semiconductor foundries including XFAB, TSMC, UMC with access ranging from 1um CMOS 600V process to 28nm LV CMOS process. 
- Training undergraduates and fresh hires to make them industry-ready in various VLSI domains including CMOS design and layout, PDK development, DRAM verification, standard-cell development.

## Current and Past Activities
