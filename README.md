# Advanced VLSI Laboratory, Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar 

The Advanced VLSI Laboratory is a Center of Excellence (CoE) for training and R&D work in the area of CMOS integrated circuits (IC) and electronic system design & manufacturing (ESDM). The CoE's primary goal is to provide an ecosystem for fostering real-life, project-based learning for the next generation engineering students and fresh graduates aspiring to start a career in VLSI industry. This will allow our students to be industry ready, bridging a critical gap between the academia and industry.

## Capabilities
