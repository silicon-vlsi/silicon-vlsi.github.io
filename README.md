# Advanced VLSI Laboratory, Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar 

The Advanced VLSI Laboratory is Center of Excellence for training and research in the area of CMOS integrated circuits and electronic system design. Our primary goal is to provide an ecosytem for fostering real-life project-based learning for the next generation engineering students. This will allow our students to be idustry ready, bridging a critical gap between the academia and industry.

**Activities** conducted in the Lab to further that goal:
- Introduce industry relevant courses in the curricullum.
- Conduct intensive courses, internships and workshops.
- Execute consulting projects from industry using our students and faculty.
- Train fresh hires from the industry in the area of VLSI design.

**Resources** available in the Lab:
- Faculties with wide ranging experience in industry and academia to teach, train and execute industry projects.
- Collaboration with industry experts to fill expertise gaps in training and project execution.
- Enterprise-grade Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools from Cadence Design Systems and Mentor Graphics.
- Collaboration with world-class foundries such as XFAB and TSMC to fabricate our designed integrated circuits.
- Enterprise-grade 40-Core Compute server with an attached NAS server to provide a world-class IT infrastructure.
- 30-seater training room for running hands on courses workshops.
- 12-seater office-cum-conference room for conducting our industry projects and training.
